# What is VoxArena?

VoxArena is an open-source voice AI platform that lets you build, test, and deploy voice agents through a web dashboard. Connect your own STT, LLM, and TTS providers, configure agents with custom system prompts and tools, and handle inbound/outbound phone calls — all with real-time transcription, cost tracking, and post-call intelligence.
