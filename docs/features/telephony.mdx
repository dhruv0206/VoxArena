# Telephony

VoxArena supports real phone calls through Twilio SIP trunks routed via LiveKit.

## Phone Number Management

Manage phone numbers directly from the dashboard or API:

- **Search**: Find available numbers by area code or country
- **Buy**: Purchase a number and assign it to an agent
- **Assign**: Assign an existing Twilio number to an agent
- **Release**: Release a number from an agent

```bash
# Search available numbers
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/telephony/numbers/search?country=US&area_code=510"

# Buy and assign to agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/telephony/numbers/buy \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone_number": "+15105550100", "agent_id": "uuid"}'
```

## Inbound Calls

When someone calls a number assigned to an agent:

1. Twilio routes the call to LiveKit via the SIP trunk
2. LiveKit's dispatch rule matches the phone number to a room
3. The agent worker joins and starts the voice pipeline
4. The backend's `/api/telephony/lookup` endpoint resolves the phone number to the correct agent

## Outbound Calls

Initiate calls from the dashboard:

1. Select an agent and enter a phone number
2. The backend creates a LiveKit SIP participant via `POST /api/calls/outbound`
3. LiveKit dials out through the Twilio SIP trunk
4. The agent joins and handles the conversation

## Prerequisites

Telephony requires:
- A Twilio account with a phone number
- Twilio Elastic SIP Trunk connected to LiveKit
- LiveKit inbound and outbound SIP trunk configuration
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_SIP_DOMAIN`, and `LIVEKIT_SIP_TRUNK_ID` in `backend/.env`

See [Telephony Setup](/configuration/telephony) for the full configuration guide.
