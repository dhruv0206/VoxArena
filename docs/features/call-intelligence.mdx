# Call Intelligence

After every completed call, VoxArena automatically analyzes the conversation transcript and generates structured insights.

## What's Analyzed

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Summary** | 2-3 sentence overview of the conversation |
| **Sentiment** | Overall caller sentiment: positive, neutral, or negative |
| **Sentiment Score** | Confidence score (0-1) for the sentiment classification |
| **Outcome** | Call outcome: resolved, unresolved, transferred, or escalated |
| **Topics** | Key topics discussed during the call |
| **Action Items** | Follow-up actions identified from the conversation |

## How It Works

1. When a session ends (`POST /api/sessions/by-room/{room_name}/end`), the backend collects all transcripts
2. The full conversation is sent to the AI analysis service
3. The analysis result is stored in the session's `analysis` JSON column
4. Results are displayed on the call details page

## Viewing Analysis

Navigate to **Dashboard → Call Logs → [Session]** to see the analysis card with:

- Summary text
- Sentiment badge with confidence percentage
- Outcome badge (color-coded)
- Topic tags
- Action item checklist

## API Access

```bash
# Get analysis for a session
curl http://localhost:8000/api/sessions/{session_id}/analysis
```
