# Call Transfer

Transfer active calls to external phone numbers with warm or cold transfer support.

## Transfer Types

### Cold Transfer

The caller is immediately connected to the target number. The agent drops off the call.

### Warm Transfer

The agent introduces the caller to the transfer target before disconnecting. This ensures a smooth handoff with context.

## Using Transfers

### From the Dashboard

On any active call in **Dashboard → Call Logs → [Session]**, the transfer controls allow you to:

1. Enter a destination phone number (E.164 format)
2. Select cold or warm transfer
3. Click Transfer

### Via API

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/sessions/{session_id}/transfer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "target_number": "+15105550200",
    "transfer_type": "cold"
  }'
```

## How It Works

1. The backend receives the transfer request
2. LiveKit creates a new SIP participant for the target number
3. For cold transfers: the original agent is removed from the room
4. For warm transfers: all three participants (caller, agent, target) are briefly connected before the agent exits
5. The session record is updated with transfer details (target, type, status)

## Session Tracking

Transfer details are stored on the session:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `transfer_target` | Destination phone number |
| `transfer_type` | `cold` or `warm` |
| `transfer_status` | Current transfer state |
