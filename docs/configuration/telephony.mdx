# Telephony Setup (Optional)

Twilio telephony is required only for inbound/outbound phone calls. Browser-based voice testing works without it.

## Setup Steps

1. Create a [Twilio account](https://www.twilio.com) and buy a phone number
2. Set up an Elastic SIP Trunk and connect it to LiveKit
3. Create LiveKit inbound/outbound SIP trunks and dispatch rules
4. Add credentials to `backend/.env`:

```bash
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token
TWILIO_SIP_DOMAIN=your-domain.pstn.twilio.com
LIVEKIT_SIP_TRUNK_ID=ST_xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Inbound calls don't reach the agent">
    - Verify the Twilio trunk has LiveKit's SIP URI as the origination URL
    - Check `lk sip inbound list` — the phone number must match exactly (with country code)
    - Check `lk sip dispatch list` — a dispatch rule must exist
    - Verify LiveKit credentials match between backend and agent
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Outbound calls fail">
    - Check `LIVEKIT_SIP_TRUNK_ID` in backend `.env` matches the outbound trunk ID
    - Verify Twilio credential list is attached to the trunk's termination settings
    - Phone numbers must be in E.164 format (e.g., `+15105550100`)
    - Check `lk sip outbound list` to verify the outbound trunk exists
